## Hero section for Prestashop home page

This is just a very basic module that allows an administrator to configure an image and some text on top of it to appear on the home page of a prestashop site.
In this first version, the image is stored in the local image directory in the module directory so you'll lose it if you reset the module!
The code is "supposed" to be compatible with Prestashop 9 and passes the automatic module validation tests.
